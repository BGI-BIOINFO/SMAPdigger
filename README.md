## Step 1 (Setup softwares)

1. cd [smapDigger root directory]
2. Execute command "chmod -R 755 ./"
3. Execute command "./Software_Setup.sh"

## Step 2 (Setup perl modules) 
### If your cannot get access to administrator mode (Not recommanded)
1, Execute command "./Module_Setup.sh [Perl module path (Absolute Full Path)]" in user mode

2, Add the path of your perl module to environmental variable $PARL5LIB in file ~/.bashrc. For most linux system, it is usually something like "export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:<Perl module path>/share/perl5/:<Perl module path>/lib64/perl5/".

3, Execute command "source ~/.bashrc"
### If your can get access to administrator mode (Strongly recommanded)
1, Execute command "./Module_Setup.sh"
## Step 3 (Data prepare)
1, Download example file package "data.tar.gz" from http://gigadb.org/dataset/100143 and save it to the root directory of SMAP. Extract the package with command "tar vxzf data.tar.gz"

2, Put file "hg19.fa" into "./data/common" directory (It could also be downloaded from http://gigadb.org/dataset/100143)

3, Check if file "hg19.chr_len.bed" is in "./data/common" directory

4, Check if file "CpGIsland.bed.seq.example" and "Upstream2k.bed.seq.example" are in "./data/element" directory

5, Check if file adapter file and raw fq files  are in "./data/sample" directory

6, Execute script "./Data_Prepare.sh" when use it first time.
## Step 4 (Configure program) 
1, modify configuration file "Eval.configure" 

2, Execute script "perl ./Monitor.pl -c Eval.configure -o [Output path]"
## Step 5 (Run program) 
1, cd [Output path] 
### If you want to run all the scripts by one step (Recommanded)
2, Execute script â€œ./SMAP_Run.sh"
### If you want to run each script one by one
2, Execute script "perl RRBS_prepare.pl"

3, Execute script "perl RRBS_asm.pl"

4, Execute script "perl RRBS_dmr.pl"

5, Execute script "./RRBS_report.sh"
